## Our Mission

Equilateral AI contributes to open source projects to:
- Improve software quality for the community
- Demonstrate our agents' capabilities transparently
- Give back to projects we use and respect
- Validate our engineering standards in real-world codebases

All contributions are made with **human oversight** and follow community guidelines.

## Our Commitment to Maintainers

### 1. Transparency
Every pull request includes:
- ðŸ¤– Clear labeling: "Generated with assistance from Equilateral AI"
- Human review: All PRs are reviewed by our team before submission
- Rationale: Detailed explanation of the problem and solution
- Tests: Comprehensive test coverage included

### 2. Quality Standards
We only submit PRs that:
- âœ… Fix genuine bugs or add requested features
- âœ… Include tests and documentation
- âœ… Follow project conventions and style guides
- âœ… Are minimal, focused, and easy to review
- âœ… Pass all existing tests and CI checks

### 3. Respect for Maintainers
We understand that:
- Maintainers volunteer their time
- PRs create review burden, even good ones
- Not all contributions are wanted, even if technically correct
- Projects have their own roadmaps and priorities

---

## Opt-Out Policy

### We Respect "No AI Contributions" Preferences

If your project prefers not to receive AI-assisted contributions, we will honor that immediately and completely.

**To opt out, simply email:**

**We will:**
- Add your project to our exclusion list within 24 hours

- Close any existing PRs and apologize for the inconvenience
- Respect your decision permanently (no re-contact)

**No justification needed.** Your project, your rules.

## Philosophy

We believe:

1. **Open source should be helped, not harmed** by AI
2. **Maintainers deserve respect**, not more unpaid work
3. **Quality over quantity** - one great PR beats ten mediocre ones
4. **Transparency builds trust** - we're open about our process
5. **Opt-out is a right** - no project owes us acceptance

Our goal is to be a **net positive** for every community we touch.
