## 🎯 Philosophy

Good software development isn't about following trends—it's about applying timeless principles that lead to quality outcomes. These standards represent lessons learned from building production systems at scale.

**Core Beliefs:**
- **Fail Fast, Fail Loud** - Make problems obvious immediately
- **No Mocks, No Fallbacks** - Real failures teach real lessons
- **Errors Are First-Class** - Design error states before happy paths
- **Explicit Over Implicit** - Code should be obvious, not clever
- **Cost-Conscious Design** - Always consider resource implications

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Add Standards to Your Project

```bash
# Option A: Add as git submodule (recommended)
git submodule add https://github.com/JamesFord-HappyHippo/EquilateralAgents-Open-Standards.git .standards

# Option B: Clone directly
git clone https://github.com/JamesFord-HappyHippo/EquilateralAgents-Open-Standards.git
```

### Step 2: Configure Your AI Coding Assistant

**Make standards enforcement automatic** by adding a "personality prompt" to your AI assistant:

```bash
# Copy the template to your project
cp .standards/CLAUDE.md.template ./CLAUDE.md

# Or for Cursor
cp .standards/CLAUDE.md.template ./.cursorrules

# Customize for your project (add project-specific rules)
# Your AI assistant will now automatically follow standards!
```

**What This Does:**
- AI assistant reads standards before every code change
- Catches violations early (mocks, vague errors, silent failures)
- Enforces error-first design automatically
- References existing patterns instead of reinventing

**Supported AI Assistants:**
- Claude Code (CLAUDE.md)
- Cursor (.cursorrules)
- Continue (.continuerc.json)
- GitHub Copilot (via .github/copilot-instructions.md)
- Any assistant that reads project context files

### Step 3: Reference in Documentation

Add to your project's README or CONTRIBUTING guide:

```markdown
## Development Standards

This project follows the [EquilateralAgents Open Standards](./.standards):

- **No Mock Data** - Failures must be visible for root cause fixes
- **Fail Fast, Fail Loud** - Make failures obvious and immediate
- **Error-First Design** - Design error states before happy path
- **Cost-Conscious** - Consider resource implications in design

See [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) for AI assistant configuration.

## 📖 Standards Overview

### 1. Core Development Principles
**File:** [development_principles.md](./development_principles.md)

Fundamental principles for quality software development:

- **No Mocks, No Fallback Data** - Production code should never hide failures with fallback values
- **Fail Fast, Fail Loud** - Make failures obvious and immediate, don't mask problems
- **Consistent Error Handling** - Use established patterns across entire application
- **Error-First Design** - Design error states before implementing happy path
- **Explicit Over Implicit** - Prefer obvious code over clever abstractions
- **Developer Experience Matters** - Optimize for the humans maintaining the code

**When to Use:** Every project, every language, every framework.

---

### 2. Cost Optimization Principles
**File:** [cost_optimization_principles.md](./cost_optimization_principles.md)

Universal patterns for building cost-effective systems:

- **Cost-First Infrastructure Design** - Always perform cost analysis during planning
- **Pay-Per-Use Default** - Only add fixed costs when measured need exists
- **Environment-Appropriate Sizing** - Dev templates for dev, production for production
- **Cost Analysis Gates** - Validate costs before deployment
- **Resource Right-Sizing** - Match resources to actual needs

**When to Use:** Any project with infrastructure costs (cloud, SaaS, compute).

---

### 3. API Design Standards
**File:** [api_design_standards.md](./api_design_standards.md)

Technology-agnostic principles for building great APIs:

- **Consistent Response Formats** - Standardize success and error responses
- **Explicit Field Naming** - Use clear, self-documenting field names
- **Proper Error Handling** - Return meaningful errors with context
- **Versioning Strategy** - Plan for API evolution from day one
- **Documentation First** - Document endpoints before implementation

**When to Use:** Building any API (REST, GraphQL, gRPC, etc.).

---

### 4. Testing Principles
**File:** [testing_principles.md](./testing_principles.md)

Fundamental approaches to effective testing:

- **Test Error States First** - Failures are more important than success cases
- **No Mocks in Integration Tests** - Test against real integrations
- **Test Data Coherence** - Test data should reflect real-world relationships
- **Failure Scenario Coverage** - Test what happens when things go wrong
- **Performance Baselines** - Establish and monitor performance expectations

**When to Use:** Every project that needs to be maintained.

---

### 5. AI Assistant Configuration
**File:** [ai_assistant_configuration.md](./ai_assistant_configuration.md)

Principles for configuring AI coding assistants to automatically follow standards:

- **Use Personality Prompts** - Context about standards, conventions, war stories
- **Frame as a Role** - "Quality-focused developer" or "Technical team lead"
- **Include Specific Examples** - Good vs bad code, specific patterns
- **Choose Right Format** - CLAUDE.md, .cursorrules, etc.
- **Make It Living Documentation** - Update when learning new patterns
- **Balance Detail with Readability** - Specific but readable (500-800 lines)
- **Test and Iterate** - Verify behavior actually changes

**When to Use:** Any project using AI coding assistants (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, etc.).

**Template Available:** [CLAUDE.md.template](./CLAUDE.md.template) - Copy and customize for your project.

## 🎓 Philosophy in Practice

### Example: The "No Mocks" Principle

**Bad Practice (Hidden Failures):**
```javascript
// API call fails, falls back to mock data
async function fetchUserData(userId) {
    try {
        return await api.getUser(userId);
    } catch (error) {
        console.log('API failed, using mock');
        return { id: userId, name: 'Test User' };  // ❌ Masks the real problem
    }
}
```

**Good Practice (Fail Fast, Fail Loud):**
```javascript
// API call fails, failure is obvious
async function fetchUserData(userId) {
    try {
        return await api.getUser(userId);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('❌ Failed to fetch user:', error);
        throw new Error(`User data unavailable: ${error.message}`);  // ✅ Obvious failure
    }
}
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Mock data hides API problems until production
- Developers get false confidence that features work
- Root causes are never fixed because failures are invisible
- Users see broken features when mocks don't match reality

---

### Example: Error-First Design

**Bad Practice (Happy Path First):**
```javascript
// Designed for success, errors are afterthought
function processPayment(amount) {
    const result = chargeCard(amount);
    return { success: true, transactionId: result.id };
    // What about failures? ❌
}
```

**Good Practice (Errors Designed First):**
```javascript
// Designed with failures in mind
function processPayment(amount) {
    // What can go wrong?
    // - Insufficient funds
    // - Invalid card
    // - Network timeout
    // - Fraud detection trigger

    try {
        const result = chargeCard(amount);
        return {
            success: true,
            transactionId: result.id
        };
    } catch (error) {
        // Explicit error handling for each case
        if (error.code === 'INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS') {
            return {
                success: false,
                error: 'INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS',
                message: 'Card declined: insufficient funds',
                userAction: 'Try a different payment method'
            };
        }
        // ... handle other specific errors
    }
}
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Error states are the majority of code paths in production
- Users experience errors, not happy paths
- Well-designed errors enable recovery
- Specific errors enable better UX
